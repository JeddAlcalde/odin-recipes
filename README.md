Initial:
Project is to create a website used to display various recipes using a main index page which will have links to other pages describing in detail specific recipes. No  CSS or JavaScript will used.

Currently I only know how to use the basics of HTML extending only as far as hyperlinks, images and file structure on the web-domain.

Finished:
Researched different ways to interact with git using different options for log and status. In HTML found ways to resize images and keep/lose original scale. Website now has 3 recipes of lasagna, adobo, and ramen. All recipes have detailed instructions and ingredient lists to help guide the user including links to the main page in case the user would like to go back and see other recipes.
