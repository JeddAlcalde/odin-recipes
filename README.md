Initial:
Project is to create a website used to display various recipes using a main index page which will have links to other pages describing in detail specific recipes. No  CSS or JavaScript will used.

Currently I only know how to use the basics of HTML extending only as far as hyperlinks, images and file structure on the web-domain.
